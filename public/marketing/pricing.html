        <h1>Forge starts at just $10 / month</h1>
        <p>Your Forge account is billed based on how much bandwidth you use. On our basic plan, if you stay under 10GB each month, you'll only be charged the base rate of $10. Extra bandwidth over that is charged at 20&cent; per gigabyte.</p>

          <h4>How much bandwidth will I need?</h4>
          <p>That depends! The more images and assets your site has, the more bandwidth you'll use serving up your site.
            The more traffic your site gets, the more bandwidth you'll use.</p>
          <p>As a rough guide, the average bandwidth for a Forge site is about <em>1GB</em> per month. That means you could host 10 sites on our Basic plan and still not be charged for extra bandwidth. Nice!</p>

          <h4>How does billing work?</h4>
          <p>Your Forge account is billed as a monthly subscription, with <b>no minimum term</b> so you can cancel, upgrade or downgrade as and when you want to.</p>
          <p>We'll bill your payment method once a month for the base rate as indicated by the plan, along with any additional bandwidth costs you incurred during the month.</p>
